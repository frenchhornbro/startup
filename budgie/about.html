                Budgie is a free and simple financial application to help you plan out your budget according to
                your expected income and expenses.

                <div>How it works:</div>
                <div>
                    Create a theoretical, or "Projected", budget based on roughly what you expect your income and expenses will be.
                    You can change this later! This will help you see how much you're making per month, as well as overall, based
                    on that plan. This will help you to see if you need to pinch pennies for the next while, or if you don't need
                    to be so tight on spending. When you receive a paycheck or pay a bill, put that in your "Actual". This will
                    help you know how well you're following your projected budget. If you'd like, you can afterwards edit your
                    projected budget to more accurately reflect your expectations for the year, or you can keep it as a goal to work
                    towards and spend accordingly in the months to come.
